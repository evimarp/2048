# 2048
Artificial Intelligence that plays 2048, each move is decided in less than 0.1 seconds.

# Introduction
2048 is single-player slide puzzing game very popular. This AI use adversarial game theory, and some weigthed heuristics for make a decision in less than 0.1second.
The result is non-deterministic, however, this algo achive 2048 +45% times, and 4096 +25% times.
I think with better heuristics, could achieve 8192 too!

# Algoritms 
This repo implements, Adversarial game and MinMax search with alpha beta pruning.
